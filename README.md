# SSOReady

We're building dev tools for implementing Enterprise SSO. You can use SSOReady to add SAML support to your product this
afternoon, for free, forever. You can think of us as an open source alternative to products like Auth0 or WorkOS.

* MIT-Licensed
* Self-hosted, or free at [app.ssoready.com](https://app.ssoready.com)
* Keeps you in control of your users database
* [Well-documented](https://ssoready.com/docs), straightforward implementation
* [Python](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-python) and
  [TypeScript/Node.js](https://github.com/ssoready/ssoready-typescript) SDKs, more in development

## Philosophy

We believe everyone that sells software to businesses should support enterprise SSO. It's a huge security win for your
customers.

The biggest problem with enterprise SSO is that it's too damn confusing. Most open-source SAML libraries are
underdocumented messes. Every time I've tried to implement SAML, I was constantly looking for someone to just tell me
WTF I was supposed to concretely do.

We believe that more people will implement enterprise SSO if you make it obvious and secure by default. We are obsessed
with giving every developer clarity and security here.

Also, we believe randomly jacking up prices on security software like this is total bullshit. MIT-licensing the software
gives you insurance against us ever doing that. Do whatever you want with the code. Fork us if we ever misbehave.
